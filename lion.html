    <h1 style="text-align: center;font: bold;font-size: larger;">Lion</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 900;">The Lion: King of the Jungle</h1>
    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most iconic and majestic wild animals in the world. Known as the "king of the jungle," this powerful big cat symbolizes strength, courage, and nobility in many cultures. Lions belong to the Felidae family and are one of the largest members of the cat family, second only to tigers in size. They are native to Africa and a small region in India, where they primarily inhabit grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Physical Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Lions have a muscular build, a deep chest, and a broad head. Their most distinctive feature is the thick mane found on male lions, which varies in color from blond to dark brown or even black. The mane serves as a sign of maturity and strength, often helping to attract females and intimidate rival males. Female lions, or lionesses, lack a mane and are slightly smaller than males, but they are equally powerful and play a crucial role in hunting.  <br>
<br>
        On average, male lions weigh between 150 and 250 kilograms (330 to 550 pounds), while females weigh between 100 and 180 kilograms (220 to 400 pounds). They can grow up to 10 feet in length, including their tail, which helps with balance while running. Lions have sharp retractable claws and strong jaws equipped with 30 teeth, including long canines for gripping and tearing prey.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Social Structure</h1>
        <p>Unlike other big cats, lions are highly social animals that live in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of 10 to 15 lions, including multiple related females, their cubs, and one or a few dominant males. The males defend the pride from intruders, while the lionesses work together to hunt and raise their young. 
            <br>
            Male lions usually leave their birth pride when they are about two or three years old, forming small coalitions with their brothers or other young males. These coalitions roam around, looking for a pride to take over. When they succeed in taking over a pride, they often kill the existing cubs to ensure that only their offspring will inherit their genes.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>The lion remains one of the most admired and feared animals in the animal kingdom. Its strength, hunting skills, and social nature make it a unique and fascinating predator. However, due to increasing threats from human activities, conservation efforts are essential to ensure that future generations can continue to witness the beauty and power of these magnificent creatures in the wild.
