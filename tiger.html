    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 900;">The Tiger: Striped Predator of the Wild</h1>
    <p>The tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) is the largest of all big cats and one of the most powerful predators in the animal kingdom. Known for its striking orange coat with black stripes, the tiger is a symbol of strength, agility, and grace. Tigers belong to the Felidae family and are native to Asia, primarily found in dense forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. These magnificent creatures are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by regulating the populations of herbivores. Their presence ensures a healthy and functional ecosystem, preventing overgrazing and promoting biodiversity.</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Physical Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Tigers have a robust build, muscular limbs, and a long tail that helps them maintain balance. Their most distinctive feature is their striped coat, which provides excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. No two tigers have the same stripe pattern, making each tiger unique. Their stripes not only serve as a form of disguise but also help them blend seamlessly with tall grasses and dense forests, allowing them to ambush prey with precision. <br><br>
        Male tigers typically weigh between 200 and 300 kilograms (440 to 660 pounds), while females weigh between 100 and 180 kilograms (220 to 400 pounds). They can grow up to 11 feet in length, including their tail. Tigers have strong jaws and sharp retractable claws that allow them to take down large prey with ease. Their powerful forelimbs enable them to deliver lethal blows, and their acute senses of sight and hearing make them formidable hunters even in low-light conditions.</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Social Structure</h1>
    <p>Unlike lions, tigers are solitary animals that prefer to hunt and live alone. Each tiger has a large territory that they mark with scent markings and scratches on trees to warn other tigers to stay away. Their solitary nature allows them to cover vast areas in search of prey, ensuring a steady food supply. The size of their territory depends on the availability of prey and the density of the forest. <br>
    Male tigers are territorial and will fight intruders to defend their domain. However, female tigers are more tolerant and may share parts of their territory with their cubs until they are old enough to survive on their own. Female tigers play a crucial role in raising their young, teaching them essential survival skills such as hunting, stalking, and defending themselves against potential threats. Cubs stay with their mother for about two years before venturing out to establish their own territories.</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align: left;font: 500;">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The tiger is one of the most fascinating and powerful animals in the wild. However, due to habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, tiger populations are declining. Conservation efforts, including protected reserves and anti-poaching laws, are essential to ensure that these magnificent creatures continue to thrive in the wild. The establishment of tiger reserves and national parks has contributed to the stabilization of some populations, but continued efforts are necessary to mitigate human encroachment and illegal wildlife trade. By raising awareness and promoting sustainable conservation initiatives, we can safeguard the future of tigers and maintain the delicate balance of our ecosystems.</p>
